A chatops-oriented chatbot written in Go, inspired by Hubot

## Quick Start

2. Copy gopherbot.template/ to ~/.gopherbot or /etc/gopherbot
3. Edit the configuration files there and supply whatever credentials are required
4. Run gopherbot with ./gopherbot.sh

## Development Status
Gopherbot is mostly feature complete, lacking mainly a brain (for persistent data storage)
