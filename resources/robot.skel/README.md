# Gopherbot Custom Configuration

This directory contains the skeleton of an example Gopherbot custom configuration repository, including an appropriate `.gitignore`.

You can create a fairly standard Gopherbot container by copying `sample.env` to `.env` and editing, then running `make; make dev` (or `make prod`).
