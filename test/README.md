This directory is used for **Gopherbot** integration tests.

These configuration sub-directories are used with the `test` connector for automated testing. See `*_test.go`. To run the robot with one of these configurations using the terminal connector, run `gopherbot` inside a configuration directory. Best to use the special build using `make testbot`.
