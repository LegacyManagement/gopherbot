# Elevated Privilege Commands

When extra security measures are desired for sensitive or potentially destructive plugin commands,
the bot administrator can configure an `ElevateMethod` which uses a two-factor authentication method
to provide sudo-like elevated privileges that drop after a configurable time out period.

# Elevators
The elevator plugin to use is selected in the bot's conf/gopherbot.yaml. Commented examples for each
elevation type are shown below. **_real work_**
