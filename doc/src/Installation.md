# Installation

The most basic install of **Gopherbot** consists of extracting the archive to `/opt/gopherbot`, creating a robot configuration repository, and running the `gopherbot` binary from the root of that directory. There are a number of other details covered in the [overview](InstallOverview.md), but that's the gist of it.
