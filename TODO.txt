- Don't assign new plugin IDs when reloading
- I don't feel like telling a joke right now. My cat just died.
- BUG: in #botdev, help joke doesn't list botdev in active channels (even if it is) - the plugin still answers, though
- Re-compile regexes if alias changes during reload; be careful about bot locking
